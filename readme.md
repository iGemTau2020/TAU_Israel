Hi there, and welcome to the Tel Aviv University 2020 iGEM team's github repository!

Within this directory, we present our two main products: the Staubility Enhancer, and our EFM Optimizer.
For these two products, we present both our compiled software, designed for off-the-shelf use, and the scripts composing it, the inputs used and the outputs obtained.

The compiled products can be found within the repository in these links:

EFM Optimizer - https://github.com/iGemTau2020/TAU_Israel/tree/main/Staubility_EFM_Optimizer/Optimizer
