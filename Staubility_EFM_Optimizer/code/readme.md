Containted within this directory are scripts used for the optimizer, and the methylation database used within the software.

Unfortunately, our code combines many frameworks, some of whom only work on certain operating systems, and some of whom require highly nontrivial installations and dependencies. Thus, running our code as a script is extremely tricky. This is part of the reason we built the GUI framework, to avoid having our users go through this process.

The code is still presented, and many internal functions from it can be scavenged for future projects. For any help, feel free to contact us at igem.tau.2019@gmail.com.
