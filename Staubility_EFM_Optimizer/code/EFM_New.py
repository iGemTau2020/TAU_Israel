    Description
    ----------
    This function optimizes the input sequence (string or SeqRecord) based on the identified suspected area for
    recombination, slippage and methylation, that are given as inputs (df_recombination, df_slippage, df_methylation).
    The identification of those areas is based on the principles that are described in the EFM calculator web tool and
    the article cited below.
    Those areas contain patterns that are likely to go under recombination, slippage or methylation, thus avoiding those
    patterns should increase the stability of the input gene.
    The translation of the gene is kept (no changes to the amino acid sequence).

    Other aspects that this optimizer takes into consideration are:
    a. If the sequence is divisible by 3, the optimization parameter is "Codon usage fraction":
    the relative frequency of the codon in the host genome (specified by the organism_name input).
    Meaning, each codon is optimized based on its frequency in the host, in one of the methods below.
    The frequency data is from kazusa database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/readme_codon.html).
    Citation: Codon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases, status for the year 2000.,
    Nakamura, Y., Gojobori, T. and Ikemura, T. (2000) Nucl. Acids Res. 28, 292.
    b. Codon Optimization method (for sequences that are divisible by 3):
        - For method = "use_best_codon", every codon will be replaced by the "best" (i.e. most frequent) synonymous codon
          in the target organism. This is equivalent to Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) optimization.
        - For method = "match_codon_usage", the final sequence's codon usage will match as much as possible the codon usage
          profile of the target species (this method is used throughout the literature,
          see for instance Hale and Thomson 1998).
        - For method = "harmonize_rca", Each codon will be replaced by a synonymous codon whose usage in the target organism
          matches the usage of the original codon in its host organism (as per Claassens 2017).
        Those methods are provided through the use of DNAchisel package for the optimization task.
    c. GC content (optional) - the requested range (minimum and maximum) of the percentage of nitrogenous bases in the
       sequence. the algorithm will split the sequence to windows of a specified size and on optimize each window.
       Basically, The lower the GC content, the more stable is the sequence, so one should take that into consideration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq: string of ACGT alphabet (copy-paste of DNA sequence), or SeqRecord (originated from a fasta file)
    miniGC and maxiGC: a numerical value from 0 to 1, specifies the range of GC content.
    window_size_GC: numerical. The window size (number of nucleotides) in which the requested GC content is to
       be maintained.
    method: optimization method.
       This is a string from the following: {"use_best_codon", "match_codon_usage", "harmonize_rca"}.
    organism_name: the name of the host of the gene. The codon optimization is done according to the host codon's frequency.
        This is a string from the following: {'b_subtilis', 'c_elegans', 'd_melanogaster', 'e_coli',
        'g_gallus', 'h_sapiens', 'm_musculus', 'm_musculus_domesticus', 's_cerevisiae','not_specified'}.
        One can access this list (aside from 'not_specified') via "python_codon_tables.available_codon_tables_names".
        If the organism is 'not_specified' then the codon optimization objective will not be defined.
    df_recombination, df_slippage, df_methylation: dataframes, each containing a list of patterns and their locations that
                                                may influence the genetic stability of the gene and thus should be avoided.
                                                These dataframes will be saved as csv. files in a different function,
                                                as the output of the EFM calculator.
    indexes: a tuple that specifies the ORF indices. For the sub-sequence in those indices, the optimizer enforces
        translation (keeps amino-acid sequence), and optimizes the codon usage. The rest of the sequence is optimized by means
        of GC content and EFM constraints (if provided).
    curr_output_path: a path in which the output report will be saved (see "returns" below).
    filename: the file name (of the output report). with a ".zip" suffix.
    with_report: a flag that indicates if the function will output a pdf report or just optimize the sequence.

    Returns
    ----------
    final_sequence: the optimized sequence
    final_record: a brief summary of the changes, includes sequence edits
    exported file named 'Translation_report.zip' if the input sequence is a string,
        or 'Translation_report_seqID.zip' if the input is FASTA format with an id.
        The file will be saved in "curr_output_path" folder.
        This file contains a report of the changes in anotated genbank format, in a pdf format and csv lists,
        all including a detailed description of the changes from the constraints and objectives."""

        'match_codon_usage', 'harmonize_rca'.

        organism_name(string): the name of the host of the gene, used for the optimization algorithms. Default value is 'not_specified'.
        possible values are {'b_subtilis', 'c_elegans', 'd_melanogaster', 'e_coli',
        'g_gallus', 'h_sapiens', 'm_musculus', 'm_musculus_domesticus', 's_cerevisiae','not_specified}.
        If the organism is 'not_specified' then the codon optimization objective will not be defined.

        indexes(dict): a dictionary of tuples (filename,seq_index), where each value is a list containing the
        sequence start and stop indexes of the ORF. It is defined within the advanced page in GUI, and defaults to None if
        the user does not specify an input.
        the convention for indexes is:
            `{
            (filename, seq_index(str)): [start(int),stop(int)] ,
            (filename, seq_index(str)): [start(int),stop(int)] , ...
            }`

    Returns:
        No variable. Saves output csv's in output_path.
