This directory contains two files:

1. Staubility_Enhancer.zip

This is our full software, zipped to a single file.
Within, you will find:
a. Gui.exe - the file running the software
b. Staubility_Enhancer_User_Guide.pdf - the user guide, available from the directory or from within the software.
c. In - a directory containing the software's dependencies.

Note, these components must be kept together, in the same directory and with the same names.

2. Staubility_Enhancer_User_Guide.pdf
This PDF is the software's user guide. It is the same one available within the zip file.


Unfortunately, our code combines many frameworks, some of whom only work on certain operating systems, and some of whom require highly nontrivial installations and dependencies. Thus, running our code as a script is extremely tricky. This is part of the reason we built the GUI framework, to avoid having our users go through this process.

The code is still presented in the other directories, and many internal functions from it can be scavenged for future projects. For any help, feel free to contact us at igem.tau.2019@gmail.com.
