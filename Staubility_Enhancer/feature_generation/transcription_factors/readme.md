## Input file
four datasets which were downloaded from YEASTRACT website. Each dataset contains two columns: the first column is the gene name, and the second column contains
the transcription regulatory sites for each specific target gene in yeast.

## Code file
TF feature.ipynb

## Output file
number_of_TF.csv, this is a dataset containing two columns: the first column is the gene name of each gene in yeast, and the second column is that gene's number of transcription regulatory sites.

## Feature
The number of transcription regulatory sites in each gene in yeast. This feature is important because the transcription factors regulate the expression levels of the genes, and thus can help us predict the intensity of fluorescence.
