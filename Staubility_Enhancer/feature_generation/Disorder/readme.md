This script uses disorder prediction results for all the yeast's genes, and creates relevant features from this data. For further reading about the data visit our wiki – model page.

**Input:**

•	Q0045_COX1_SGDID_S000007260.merged. This is one file out of 5500 files used. As the data does not belong to us, we uploaded one file due to copyrights.
Each file is a prediction result for one gene. In each file, there is a per-residue (or amino acid) prediction results from disorder prediction algorithms and ANCHOR disordered binding sites.

**Code:** The data is processed using the 'disorder.m' matlab script.

**Output: 'disorder_output.xlsx' (columns=features, rows=genes).**

The file contains the following features:

1.	Gene_name: the gene's name taken from the file's name.

2.	Mean_score:mean of all the numerical columns in the original file for all positions.

3.	 Disorder_percentage1: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions by consensus approach #1 (Explained on our wiki). We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene (3/4 in column 7 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.

4.	Disorder_percentage2: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions by consensus approach #2 (Explained on our wiki). We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene ("DISORDERED" in column 8 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.

5.	Disorder_percentage_both_algorithms: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene when both 
consensus approaches determined the site as disordered ("DISORDERED" in column 8 and 3/4 value in column 7 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.

6.	Anchor_disorder_percentage: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene (1 in column 13 in the original file) and divided by the number of positions.

7.	Anchor_percentage: we calculated the mean Anchor score on all the gene's positions in column 12 in the original file (Anchor score, explained on our wiki).

8.	IUPRED_percentage: we calculated the mean IUPRED score on all the gene's positions in column 3 in the original file (IUPRED score, explained on our wiki).

9.	VSL2B_percentage: we calculated the mean VSL2B score on all the gene's positions in column 4 in the original file (VSL2B score, explained on our wiki).

10.	DisEMBL_percentage: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder sites in the gene ("DISORDERED" in column 5 in the original file,DisEMBL, , explained on our wiki) and divided by the number of positions.

11.	MoreRONN_percentage: we calculated the mean MoreRONN score on all the gene's positions in column 6 in the original file (MoreRONN score, explained on our wiki).

12.	Disorder30_percentage: for each gene, this score is calculated using all the gene's positions. We counted the number of disorder30 sites in the gene ("DIS_30" in column 9 in the original file, explained on our wiki) and divided by the number of positions.

13.	Disorder_percentage1_window1-Disorder_percentage1_window30: each window contains 50 gene's positions and the starting point for each window is the number of the window. For example, window 17 is from position 17 until position 66. In each window we counted the number for disordered positions according to consensus #1 and divided by 50. If the gene's length is smaller than 79 than some windows aren't full and therefore these window's value will be NaN.

14.	Disorder_std1_window1-Disorder_std1_window30: in each window detailed in 13, we calculated the standard deviation (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

15.	Disorder_percentage2_window1-Disorder_percentage2_window30: same as described in 13 using consensus #2 (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

16.	Disorder_std2_window1-Disorder_std2_window30: same as described in 14 using consensus #2 (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

17.	Disorder30_percentage_window1- Disorder30_percentage_window30: the windows are same as described before. In each window we counted the number of "DIS_30" values and divided by 50 (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

18.	Disorder30_std_window1- Disorder30_std_window30: we created a vector of 0 and 1 when 1="DIS_30" and 0="ORD_30" and for each window and calculated the vector's std (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

19.	Disorder_anchor_percentage_window1- Disorder_anchor_percentage_window30: the windows are same as describe before. The calculation is same as described 6 but for every window (If not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

20.	Disorder_anchor_std_window1- Disorder_anchor_std_window30: the anchor's values are 0/1, therefore std was easily computed for every window (if not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

21.	Max_disorder_percentage_window1: Max_disorder_percentage_window30- for every window, we calculate the maximal score among all the positions and all the score columns in the original file (3,4,6,12) (if not possible due to incomplete window the value assigned is NaN).

22.	Disorder_percentage1_lastwindow, Disorder_std1_lastwindow, Disorder_percentage2_lastwindow, Disorder_std2_lastwindow,  Disorder30_percentage_lastwindow,Disorder30_std_lastwindow, Disorder_anchor_percentage_lastwindow, Disorder_anchor_std_lastwindow, Max_disorder_percentage_lastwindow:
the following were calculate the same way described in 13-21, but the respective window was different. Here the features were calculated only for the last window- the last 50 positions in the gene, therefore there aren't NaN values.

**NOTE:If the sequence is smaller than 129 the last window shares some of its positions with the first 30 windows.**
